## Datasets
The `datasets/` folder contains the data for the two datasets used in our paper - Deepfake and RIP.
The `test_with_statistics.csv` contains test data with several statistics computed from the `textdescriptives` library.

## Helper Code

## Experiments
Experiment data - such as models, predictions, and metrics - can be found in the respective folders. Jupyter (Kaggle) notebooks are also present.
